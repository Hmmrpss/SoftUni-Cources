Test Client

Create a test client that tests your BankAccount class.

Support the following commands:
•	Create {Id}
•	Deposit {Id} {Amount}
•	Withdraw {Id} {Amount}
•	Print {Id}
•	End

If you try to create an account with existing Id, print "Account already exists".
If you try to perform an operation on non-existing account with existing Id, print "Account does not exist".
If you try to withdraw an amount larger than the balance, print "Insufficient balance".
The Print command should print "Account ID{id}, balance {balance}". Round the balance to the second digit after the decimal separator.
